This program builds a triangle object based
on the side lengths that the user provides.
The class will verify the side lengths cooperate
with the rule that the sum of any two sides
must be greater than the third. Once the triangle
is made, the perimeter and area are reported
by the program. In order to test this program, compile
and run the Driver.java file.
