PROJECT TITLE: genome-simulation-project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Simulate a prokaryotic genome and try to find
open reading frames in the genome. We should notice that a large
number of "fake" open reading frames are found, but that they are
usually short in length.
VERSION or DATE: 04/17/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Currently, only the RandomSequenceTester
is a functional test point.
AUTHORS: Roshan Sen
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Use RandomSequenceTester for now.
